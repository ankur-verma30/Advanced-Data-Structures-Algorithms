/*
You are given a multiset of N integers. Please find such a non-empty subset of it that the sum of the subset's elements is divisible by by N. Otherwise, state that this subset does not exist 
-1 if the required subset does not exist.
If the subset exists, output two lines. Output the size of the subset on the first line and output the list of indices of the multiset's elements that form the required subset. Of course, number can be taken in the subset no more than once.
